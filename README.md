The Data for these visuals were taken from Citi-bike Information and were compiled for the last 5 years
from 2017 through Nov of 2021. 

The first piece of information that we are going to look at is an overview of all Citi-bike Locations.
The bubbles on the maps show the total amount of starts and ends at a certain Citi-Bike location. 
One of the first things that we see is that the Downtown Jersey City locations have the best 
start and end numbers. At first my assumption would have been that Downtown Jersey City city is a more
wealthy area that Citi-Bikes are supplied. This is why we added the Median Household Income Data by Area 
onto the map. With this additional information we can see that the Hoboken area and the Dowtown Jersey
City area are very close to the same as Median Household Income is concerned. With this the lower Median 
Household Incomes areas of Indian Square, Liberty Light Rail down near Communipaw, and the Montgomery
St. Locations out perform Hoboken. 


Going further into the data concerning Start and End Locations, we decided to look into the Top 10 Start
locations that is seen on the left, as well as the Top 10 End Locations as seen on the right. We see a lot
of the same locations that come up strong in both start and end locations. But there are two that I would 
like to point out as different. The first being that the Morris Canal location is in the Top 10 Start 
locations, but not in the Top 10 End location list. Instead City Hall is in the End Location Top 10, but not 
in the Start Locations Top 10. This leads me to believe that the high majority of people that are using 
Citi-Bikes are using them for their Downtown activities instead of using them for actual travel. 


Finally, We wanted to see the Peak hours of Citi-Bike usage in both the Summer and Winter Months by tracking
the start time by hour. As we can see that there is a spike in Start times consistently summer and winter in
in the morning and evening. During the Summer months the 8AM start time increases through June, July and August. 
As does the 6pm Start time. During the Summer months August is where we see the highest usage of Citi-Bike. 
It would be interesting to cross reference this with some tourist information or Vacation days most likely taken. 
The Winter Months follow suit with the two hours that show the highest numbers for the day 8am and 6PM. but this 
time they have switched with 8AM putting up the highest numbers. As well we see that January is the overall
strongest month with Febuary not far behind. Overall though the peak numbers of summer hovering around an average 
of 20 thousand (plus in August), leaves the Winter months no where close to their numbers as the peak of January 
only gets an average of 9.4 thousand.
